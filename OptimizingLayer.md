## 7. Caching, CDN, and Proxy Layers

### 7.1. Caching

Stores frequently accessed data to improve speed.

- **Browser cache**
- **Server cache**
- **Reverse proxy cache (e.g., Nginx, Varnish)**

### 7.2. CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Distributes static assets across global servers to minimize latency for users worldwide.

### 7.3. Proxy and Load Balancer

- **Forward proxy:** Acts on behalf of the client.
- **Reverse proxy:** Acts on behalf of the server (common in backend).
- **Load balancer:** Distributes requests among multiple servers.

### 7.4. Compression & Optimization

Techniques like Gzip, Brotli, and image compression reduce bandwidth and speed up load time.
