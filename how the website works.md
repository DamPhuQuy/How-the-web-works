Perfect 👍 Let’s build the **English version of the roadmap** so you can use it directly for your fullstack web dev journey.

# 🌐 Fullstack Web Developer Roadmap to Understand How a Website Works (2 Layers)

---

## **Layer 1: Big Picture – End-to-End Flow**

Follow the flow of what happens when a user types a URL.
👉 At each step, just focus on **what it does, why it exists, and a small hands-on test**.

### **1. User enters a URL**

- Knowledge: URL structure (`protocol://domain:port/path?query#fragment`).
- Practice: Break down a real URL like `https://www.google.com/search?q=chatgpt`.

---

### **2. DNS Resolution**

- Knowledge: Convert domain → IP (browser cache → OS cache → recursive resolver → authoritative server).
- Practice: Run `nslookup google.com` or `dig openai.com`.

---

### **3. TCP/IP & OSI Models**

- Knowledge: Request travels through layers → Application (HTTP) → Transport (TCP) → Internet (IP) → Link (Ethernet/Wi-Fi).
- Practice: Draw a mapping OSI ↔ TCP/IP.

---

### **4. TCP Handshake & HTTPS**

- Knowledge: TCP 3-way handshake, TLS handshake for encryption.
- Practice: Chrome DevTools → Network → pick a request → check _Initial connection_ and _SSL handshake_.

---

### **5. HTTP Request/Response**

- Knowledge: Request = method + URL + headers + body. Response = status code + headers + body.
- Practice: `curl -v https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1`.

---

### **6. Web Server**

- Knowledge: Web server (Nginx, Apache, Node.js) receives requests → serves static files or forwards to backend.
- Practice: Write a tiny server (Node.js `http` module or Python Flask) returning “Hello World”.

---

### **7. Backend Application**

- Knowledge: Backend handles business logic, queries DB, returns data (REST API).
- Practice: Create a route `/users` returning JSON `{ id:1, name:"Alice" }`.

---

### **8. Database**

- Knowledge: Backend queries SQL/NoSQL to fetch/store data.
- Practice: Create a `users` table and fetch it from backend.

---

### **9. Response back to Browser**

- Knowledge: Data travels back over TCP/IP → Browser receives response → starts parsing HTML/CSS/JS.
- Practice: Open DevTools → Network → inspect response headers/body.

---

### **10. Browser Rendering**

- Knowledge:

  - HTML → DOM
  - CSS → CSSOM
  - DOM + CSSOM → Render Tree → Paint

- Practice: Open DevTools → Elements → edit DOM and see UI changes live.

---

### **11. Frontend Interactivity**

- Knowledge: JS handles events, fetches data, updates DOM.
- Practice: Button → fetch API `/users` → display list dynamically.

---

✅ After finishing Layer 1, you’ll have the **100% end-to-end picture**.

---

## **Layer 2: Deep Dive – Drill into Each Step**

Once you’ve got the flow, pick a step and dive deeper.

### **DNS (step 2)**

- Root servers, TLD, Authoritative servers.
- DNS caching (local, recursive, browser).
- Record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT.
- Practice: `dig +trace openai.com`.

---

### **TCP/IP & HTTPS (steps 3–4)**

- TCP vs UDP, ports, congestion control.
- TLS handshake, asymmetric vs symmetric encryption, CA certificates.
- Practice: Use Wireshark to capture HTTPS packets.

---

### **HTTP (step 5)**

- Status codes (2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx).
- Headers: caching, cookies, authentication.
- REST vs GraphQL vs WebSocket.
- Practice: Use Postman to test GET/POST/PUT/DELETE.

---

### **Web Server (step 6)**

- Static vs dynamic content.
- Reverse proxy, load balancer.
- Virtual hosts, ports.
- Practice: Configure Nginx as reverse proxy for Node.js app.

---

### **Backend (step 7)**

- MVC pattern, routing, middleware.
- Authentication: JWT, OAuth.
- Error handling, logging.
- Practice: Build CRUD API for `users`.

---

### **Database (step 8)**

- SQL vs NoSQL.
- Indexing, query optimization.
- Transactions, ACID.
- Practice: Compare query performance with and without index.

---

### **Browser (steps 9–10)**

- Event loop, call stack, async/await.
- Critical rendering path, reflow vs repaint.
- Practice: Measure performance with Lighthouse.

---

### **Frontend (step 11)**

- SPA vs MPA.
- State management.
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite).
- Practice: Use React or Vue to fetch API data and render list.

## 📌 How to Avoid Tutorial Hell

1. **Finish Layer 1 first** → get the full journey clear in your mind.
2. **Only dive deeper (Layer 2)** when something feels fuzzy or when you actually need it for a project.
3. **Always do small hands-on tests** → theory alone will cause overload.

---

👉 With this 2-layer roadmap, you’ll:

- See the **end-to-end big picture** of how a website works.
- Have a **structured plan to deep dive** into each step without getting lost.

Do you want me to **draw this roadmap as a flowchart/mindmap** (User → DNS → … → Frontend, each node with a Deep Dive branch) so you can study it visually?
